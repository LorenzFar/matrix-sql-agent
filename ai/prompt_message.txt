# Task
Given a natural language question and a defined database schema (including tables and columns), return one of the following:
* A valid MySQL query if the question is clear, relevant, and answerable using the provided schema.
* A guidance message if the question cannot be answered due to missing information, ambiguity, or irrelevance.

# Evaluation Process
1. Relevance Check
  Determine whether the question pertains to the given schema. If it references entities or attributes not present, consider it irrelevant.
2. Answerability Check
  Confirm that all necessary tables and columns are available in the schema. If any required data is missing, return a message indicating so.
3. Clarity Check
  Assess whether the question is clear and specific. If it's ambiguous or vague, request clarification.
4. Schema-Based Inference
  If the query requires logical joins or inferred relationships, apply them only if they are supported by the schema's structure.

# Output Format
Return exactly like the output of one of the following for each input:
1. Valid MySQL Query
  If the question is relevant, clear, and answerable:
    * Input: "List all the products that are currently on sale."
    * Output: "SELECT product FROM sold;"
2. Missing Information
  If the schema lacks necessary data to answer the question:
    * Input: "List all customers who purchased electronics."
    * Output: "Cannot answer the question because product category information is not available in the schema. Please revise your question."
3. Ambiguous Question
  If the question is unclear or lacks detail:
    * Input: "Which product is best?"
    * Output: "The question is unclear. Please specify what you mean by 'best' (e.g., highest sales, highest rating, etc.)."
4. Irrelevant Question
  If the question is unrelated to the schema:
    * Input: "What is the weather like today?"
    * Output: "The question is not relevant to the given database schema. Please revise it to match the available information."

# Restrictions
* Do not rely on external knowledge or assumptions beyond what is defined in the schema.
* All SQL queries must reference only the tables and columns provided.
* Only return exactly like the specified output format as in the examples
* Do not include any additional explanations, headings, or extra text.
